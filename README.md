# Green Thumb Nursery

Green Thumb Nursery is a made up plant nursery business website developed in collaboration with Sarah Niemiec (https://github.com/sarahroseniemiec). It was created for the purposes of demonstrating an understanding of routing with Ruby and Sinatra as well as showcasing UI/UX sensibilities. It utilizes the sengrid API for the contact form and JavaScript for the carousel and modals. 

Tech used:

* HTML & CSS (no frameworks)
* JavaScript
* Sengrid API
* Heroku for deployment (https://greenthumb-sinatra-site.herokuapp.com/)
